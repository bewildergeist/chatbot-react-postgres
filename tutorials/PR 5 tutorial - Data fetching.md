## 🗺️ Overview

This tutorial introduces React Router v7's data loading pattern, a fundamental shift from traditional React state management for data fetching. Instead of using `useState` and `useEffect` to fetch data after a component renders, we'll use `clientLoader` functions to fetch data _before_ rendering.

You'll learn how to:

- Transform components from using local state to loader-provided data
- Understand the loader lifecycle and when loaders run
- Implement parent-child loader relationships
- Provide visual feedback during navigation and data loading

By the end, you'll have converted a basic chat application from client-side state management to React Router's declarative data loading pattern, with visual feedback for navigation states.

## Step 1: Introduce clientLoader for data fetching in chat threads

### 🤔 Problem to solve

Currently, the chat thread component uses `useState` to manage messages data locally. This means the component renders first, then manages its own data. This approach has several drawbacks:

- You need to handle loading states manually
- Data isn't guaranteed to be available when the component renders
- Each component must implement its own data fetching logic
- No coordination between URL changes and data loading

**Your challenge**: Transform the chat thread route to use React Router's `clientLoader` pattern instead of local state management.

### 💡 Key concepts

**clientLoader function:**

- An async function exported from a route file
- Runs _before_ the route component renders
- Receives route `params` (like `threadId`) and the `request` object
- Returns data that becomes available via the `useLoaderData()` hook

**useLoaderData hook:**

- Provides type-safe access to data returned from `clientLoader`
- Data is guaranteed to be available when the component renders
- Eliminates the need for loading states within the component

**Loader lifecycle:**

- Loader runs when navigating to the route
- Loader runs on page refresh
- Loader runs when React Router revalidates data (after mutations)

### 📝 Your task

Transform the `chat-thread.jsx` route to use the `clientLoader` pattern:

1. **Export a `clientLoader` function** that:

   - Is async and receives `{ params }` as its argument
   - Extracts `threadId` from `params`
   - Simulates a network delay (500ms) using `setTimeout` with a Promise
   - Returns mock message data that includes the `threadId` and a `messages` array
   - Each message should have: `id`, `type` ("user" or "bot"), and `content`

2. **Update the component** to:
   - Remove the `useState` import and usage
   - Import and use `useLoaderData` instead of `useParams`
   - Extract both `threadId` and `messages` from the loader data
   - Keep the `addMessage` function for now (just log a message that mutations will be implemented later)

### 🔍 Implementation hints

<details>
<summary>How do I create a simulated delay?</summary>

Use `setTimeout` wrapped in a Promise:

```javascript
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>What should the loader return?</summary>

Return an object with the data your component needs:

```javascript
return {
  threadId: params.threadId,
  messages: [...] // array of message objects
};
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I access loader data in the component?</summary>

```javascript
const { threadId, messages } = useLoaderData();
```

</details>

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **Why is data loading separated from the component?** What advantages does this provide compared to using `useEffect` to fetch data after rendering?

2. **What happens during the time between clicking a link and the loader completing?** How does the user experience change?

3. **When would you still use `useState` instead of a loader?** Can you think of types of data that should remain in component state?

### 🧪 Test your solution

- Navigate between different thread IDs in the URL
- Check that the messages display the correct `threadId`
- Observe the 500ms delay before the new thread renders
- Open the browser's Network tab - notice no actual network requests (it's mock data)
- Try refreshing the page - the loader should run again

After attempting the implementation yourself, review the commit to see one approach to solving this step. Notice how:

- The `clientLoader` function is exported separately from the component
- The loader returns structured data as a plain object
- The component code is simplified by removing state management
- Comments explain the loader lifecycle and key concepts

## Step 2: Load thread list via clientLoader in layout route

### 🤔 Problem to solve

You successfully implemented a loader for the chat thread route, but now you have thread list data in the `Layout` component that's still using `useState`. The sidebar needs to display a list of all available threads, and this data should be loaded before the layout renders.

Additionally, you need to understand **parent route loaders** - how do loaders work when routes are nested?

**Your challenge**: Add a `clientLoader` to the layout route that fetches the thread list data before rendering.

### 💡 Key concepts

**Parent route loaders:**

- Parent loaders run _before_ child route loaders
- Data from parent loaders is available to the parent component via `useLoaderData()`
- Child routes can access parent loader data using `useRouteLoaderData(routeId)`
- This creates a data loading waterfall: parent loads → parent renders → child loads → child renders

**Shared layout data:**

- Layouts provide consistent UI structure (like a sidebar) across multiple child routes
- Layout loaders are ideal for data that multiple child routes need
- The `<Outlet />` component renders the matched child route within the layout

**Data loading patterns:**

- Each route is responsible for loading its own data
- Routes declare their data dependencies through loaders
- React Router handles the coordination and timing

### 📝 Your task

Add a `clientLoader` to the `layout.jsx` route:

1. **Export a `clientLoader` function** that:

   - Is async (no parameters needed for this loader)
   - Simulates a network delay (300ms)
   - Returns mock thread data as an array
   - Each thread should have: `id` (as a string) and `title`
   - Include at least 10 threads for testing the scrollable sidebar

2. **Update the Layout component** to:
   - Remove the `useState` import and usage
   - Import and use `useLoaderData` to access the threads
   - Keep the `deleteThread` function for now (just log that mutations will be implemented later)

### 🔍 Implementation hints

<details>
<summary>Do I need params in the layout loader?</summary>

No! The layout route doesn't have any URL parameters, so your loader doesn't need to accept any arguments (or you can accept `{ params }` but won't use it).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are thread IDs strings now?</summary>

Database IDs are typically strings (UUIDs or similar). Converting now prepares the app for real database integration later.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the loading sequence?</summary>

When navigating to `/chat/3`:

1. Layout loader runs (300ms delay)
2. Layout component renders with thread list
3. Chat thread loader runs (500ms delay)
4. Chat thread component renders with messages

Total wait time: 800ms

</details>

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **What's the advantage of loading thread data in the layout?** Why not load it in each child route that needs it?

2. **How does the loading waterfall affect user experience?** Is the 800ms total wait time a problem? What are the tradeoffs?

### 🧪 Test your solution

- Navigate to the chat app and observe the sidebar loading
- Add a `console.log` in both loaders to see the execution order
- Try navigating between threads - the layout loader should NOT run again (only the child loader runs)
- Refresh the page - both loaders should run in sequence
- Check that thread IDs are strings (you'll see them in the URL)

### ✅ Reference implementation

**🔗 Commit**: [`39e3f53`](5/commits/39e3f5332b6192dbce4955a45df4af482b9567eb)

Review the commit to see how:

- The layout loader provides thread data to the sidebar
- Thread IDs are converted to strings
- The component is simplified by removing state management
- The `deleteThread` callback is temporarily neutered (mutations come later)

## Step 3: Use NavLink to highlight active thread in sidebar

### 🤔 Problem to solve

Your sidebar now displays a list of threads, but there's no visual indication of which thread is currently active. Users can't easily tell which conversation they're viewing.

React Router provides `NavLink` - a special version of `Link` that automatically tracks whether it matches the current URL. You need to use this to highlight the active thread.

**Your challenge**: Replace the `Link` component with `NavLink` and add conditional styling for the active state.

### 💡 Key concepts

**NavLink component:**

- A special version of `Link` that knows when it matches the current route
- Provides routing state (`isActive`, `isPending`) via a className callback
- Automatically manages active state without manual tracking

**className callback pattern:**

```javascript
<NavLink
  to="/somewhere"
  className={({ isActive, isPending }) => {
    // Return a string of class names
    // You have access to isActive and isPending booleans
  }}
/>
```

**Conditional class application:**

- You can return different class names based on the state
- Common patterns: ternary operator, array filter, or template strings

### 📝 Your task

Update the `ChatThreadItem` component in `Sidebar.jsx`:

1. **Import `NavLink`** from React Router (in addition to `Link`)

2. **Replace `Link` with `NavLink`** for the thread link

3. **Update the className prop** to use a callback function that:

   - Accepts `{ isActive, isPending }` as parameters
   - Returns the base class `"chat-thread-link"`
   - Adds `"chat-thread-link-active"` when `isActive` is true
   - Use whatever pattern you prefer (ternary, array filter, etc.)

4. **Add CSS styling** for the active state in `app.css`:
   - Target the `.chat-thread-link-active` class
   - Make it visually distinct (e.g., `font-weight: bold`)

### 🔍 Implementation hints

<details>
<summary>Pattern 1: Ternary operator</summary>

```javascript
className={({ isActive }) =>
  isActive
    ? "chat-thread-link chat-thread-link-active"
    : "chat-thread-link"
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Pattern 2: Array filter</summary>

```javascript
className={({ isActive }) =>
  ["chat-thread-link", isActive && "chat-thread-link-active"]
    .filter(Boolean)
    .join(" ")
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Pattern 3: Template string</summary>

```javascript
className={({ isActive }) =>
  `chat-thread-link ${isActive ? "chat-thread-link-active" : ""}`
}
```

</details>

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **Why is NavLink better than manually tracking the active route?** What would you need to do without NavLink?

2. **What's the difference between `isActive` and `isPending`?** When is each one true?

3. **Which className pattern do you prefer and why?** Consider readability, scalability, and handling multiple conditional classes.

### 🧪 Test your solution

- Click on different threads in the sidebar
- Verify that the active thread is highlighted
- Navigate using the browser's back/forward buttons
- The highlighting should automatically update
- Try navigating directly via URL - the correct thread should be highlighted

## Step 4: Add pending state animation to thread links

### 🤔 Problem to solve

When you click a thread link, there's a 500ms delay while the loader fetches data (in a real app, this could be even longer). During this time, nothing happens visually - the user might wonder if their click registered.

You need to provide visual feedback during the loading state to improve perceived performance.

**Your challenge**: Use the `isPending` state from `NavLink` to show a pulsating animation while the new thread data is loading.

### 💡 Key concepts

**isPending state:**

- Provided by `NavLink` in the className callback
- True when navigation to this route has started but the loader hasn't completed
- Automatically managed by React Router
- Provides opportunity for loading feedback

**Perceived performance:**

- Users perceive apps as faster when they get immediate feedback
- Loading animations make waits feel shorter
- Indication that "something is happening" reduces frustration

### 📝 Your task

Update the `NavLink` in `ChatThreadItem` and add CSS animations:

1. **Update the className callback** to handle `isPending`:

   - Accept both `{ isActive, isPending }` parameters
   - Add `"chat-thread-link-pending"` class when `isPending` is true
   - Ensure both active and pending classes can apply simultaneously
   - Use the array filter pattern (it's cleanest for multiple conditional classes)

2. **Create a pulsating animation** in `app.css`:

   - Define a `@keyframes pulse` animation
   - Animate the text color between `var(--text-primary)` and `var(--text-muted)`
   - Use 0% and 100% for the primary color, 50% for the muted color
   - Set animation duration to 0.6s for quick, noticeable feedback

3. **Apply the animation** to the pending class:
   - Target `.chat-thread-link-pending`
   - Use `animation: pulse 0.6s ease-in-out infinite`

### 🔍 Implementation hints

<details>
<summary>How do I combine multiple conditional classes?</summary>

```javascript
className={({ isActive, isPending }) =>
  [
    "chat-thread-link",
    isActive && "chat-thread-link-active",
    isPending && "chat-thread-link-pending",
  ]
    .filter(Boolean)
    .join(" ")
}
```

The `filter(Boolean)` removes any `false` values from the array.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the keyframe syntax?</summary>

```css
@keyframes pulse {
  0%,
  100% {
    color: var(--text-primary);
  }
  50% {
    color: var(--text-muted);
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why 0.6s duration?</summary>

A short duration (0.6s) means the animation completes quickly, making the pulsing noticeable. If the loader takes 500ms, the user will see almost one full pulse cycle.

</details>

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **When is `isPending` true vs `isActive` true?** Can they both be true at the same time? What about neither?

2. **How does visual feedback affect user experience?** Have you noticed similar patterns in other apps?

3. **What other types of pending state feedback could you provide?** Could you show a loading spinner? Disable the link? What are the tradeoffs?

### 🧪 Test your solution

- Click on a thread and watch for the pulsating animation
- The animation should stop when the new thread loads
- If you click quickly between threads, each pending link should pulse
- Try clicking the already-active thread - you should see pending state briefly
- Adjust the loader delay to see how it affects the animation perception
