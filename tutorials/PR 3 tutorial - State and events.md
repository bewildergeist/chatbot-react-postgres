## Step 1: Mastering props destructuring

### 🤔 Problem to solve

As React applications grow, accessing props with `props.propName` everywhere becomes verbose and makes components harder to read. We need a cleaner way to work with props.

### 💡 Key concepts

- **Props destructuring** extracts specific props directly in function parameters
- **Default values** prevent errors when props are undefined
- **Self-documenting code** makes component interfaces clearer

### 🔍 What changed

**🔗 Commit**: [`edc0b74`](3/commits/edc0b74ee1c4a61ba284bab32c1176a4fc19a2e9)

This commit transforms all components to use destructuring patterns:

```javascript
// Before
function Message(props) {
  return <div className={props.type}>{props.children}</div>;
}

// After
function Message({ type = "user", children }) {
  return <div className={type}>{children}</div>;
}
```

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **Why are default values important?** What happens if a parent component forgets to pass a required prop?
2. **How does destructuring make code more maintainable?** Consider a component that uses 5-6 different props.

### ✅ Check your understanding

- Look at the `ChatThreadsList` component. What would happen without the `threads = []` default value?
- Try removing a default value and see what error you get in the browser console.

## Step 2: Adding interactive UI elements

### 🤔 Problem to solve

Static websites are boring! Users expect to interact with elements. We need to add buttons that appear on hover and provide visual feedback.

### 💡 Key concepts

- **Semantic HTML** using proper button elements for interactions
- **CSS hover states** for progressive disclosure of UI elements
- **Accessibility** with ARIA labels and focus management
- **Flexbox layouts** for aligning interactive elements

### 🔍 What changed

**🔗 Commit**: [`17812b4`](3/commits/17812b46701fd489a722fced2e81579fa07fb7f2)

This commit adds delete buttons that appear when hovering over thread items:

- Button hidden by default with `opacity: 0`
- Appears on hover with smooth transitions
- Red color indicates destructive action
- Proper accessibility attributes

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **Why hide buttons until hover?** What are the UX benefits of progressive disclosure?
2. **How do accessibility attributes help users?** Consider users with screen readers or keyboard navigation.

### ⚠️ Common mistakes

- Forgetting `type="button"` makes buttons submit forms unexpectedly
- Missing hover states confuse users about clickable elements
- Poor color choices don't communicate button purpose

### ✅ Check your understanding

- Inspect the CSS to understand how the hover effect works
- Try tabbing through the interface - can you focus the delete buttons with a keyboard?

---

## Step 3: Handling events and debugging

### 🤔 Problem to solve

Pretty buttons are useless without functionality! We need to respond to user interactions and debug what's happening during development.

### 💡 Key concepts

- **Event handlers** functions that respond to user interactions
- **Event objects** contain information about what happened
- **Event.stopPropagation()** prevents unwanted event bubbling
- **Console logging** for debugging and development

### 🔍 What changed

**🔗 Commit**: [`2034b20`](3/commits/2034b200f56338eddcac3d02a98b982aa17b7754)

This commit adds click functionality to delete buttons:

```javascript
const handleDeleteClick = (event) => {
  event.stopPropagation(); // Don't trigger parent link
  console.log("Delete button clicked for thread:", {
    id: id,
    title: title,
    href: href,
    element: event.target,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
};
```

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **Why is `stopPropagation()` necessary?** What happens if you remove it?
2. **What information is useful for debugging?** How can console logs help during development?

### 🔍 Explore the code

Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and click delete buttons. Watch the console output and understand what data is available.

### ✅ Check your understanding

- Try clicking both the thread title and delete button. What's the difference in behavior?
- Modify the console.log to include additional event properties. What else can you access?

---

## Step 4: Managing state with React hooks

### 🤔 Problem to solve

Console logging is great for debugging, but users expect buttons to actually do something! We need to manage changing data over time and remove threads when deleted.

### 💡 Key concepts

- **useState hook** for managing dynamic data
- **State updates** must be immutable (create new arrays, don't modify existing ones)
- **Callback props** for passing functions to child components
- **Unidirectional data flow** - data flows down, events flow up

### 🔍 What changed

**🔗 Commit**: [`33de560`](3/commits/33de56090b7491b82d2caf6028bb3140f6c0c5c4)

This is a major transformation! The static `threads` array becomes dynamic state:

```jsx
// In layout.jsx
const [threads, setThreads] = useState(initialThreads);

const deleteThread = (threadId) => {
  setThreads((currentThreads) =>
    currentThreads.filter((thread) => thread.id !== threadId)
  );
};
```

The delete callback flows down through the component hierarchy:
Layout → Sidebar → ChatThreadsList → ChatThreadItem

### 💡 Think about this

Before looking at the implementation: How would you remove an item from an array without modifying the original array?

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **Why use `filter()` instead of `splice()`?** What's the difference between mutating and creating new arrays?
2. **How does the callback pattern work?** Trace the path from clicking delete to updating state.

### 🔍 Explore the code

Click delete buttons and watch threads disappear! Open React DevTools to see state changes in real-time.

### ✅ Check your understanding

- What happens if you forget to pass `onDeleteThread` to a child component?
- Try modifying the delete function to restore a thread after 3 seconds using `setTimeout`.

---

## Step 5: Form handling and component state

### 🤔 Problem to solve

The chat input looks like a form but doesn't behave like one. We need proper form submission, loading states, and user feedback during async operations.

### 💡 Key concepts

- **Form elements** and semantic HTML for better accessibility
- **onSubmit handlers** vs onClick handlers
- **Component-level state** with useState
- **Conditional rendering** based on state values
- **Async operation simulation** for realistic user experience

### 🔍 What changed

**🔗 Commit**: [`c1f8119`](3/commits/c1f8119808be387e49af90c3e0325f2568b6704c)

The ChatInput transforms from a static layout to an interactive form:

```javascript
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = React.useState(false);

const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  setIsSubmitting(true);

  setTimeout(() => {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }, 1000);
};
```

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **Why use a form element instead of just div + button?** Consider keyboard users and screen readers.
2. **When should you show loading states?** How do they improve user experience?

### ⚠️ Common mistakes

- Forgetting `event.preventDefault()` causes page refreshes
- Not disabling buttons during submission allows double-clicks
- Missing loading states leave users wondering if something happened

### ✅ Check your understanding

- Try submitting the form multiple times quickly. What prevents duplicate submissions?
- Press Enter while focused in the textarea. Does the form submit properly?

---

## Step 6: State lifting and parent-child communication

### 🤔 Problem to solve

The chat input can submit but messages don't appear anywhere! We need to connect form submission to the messages list through shared state.

### 💡 Key concepts

- **State lifting** - moving state up to the nearest common parent
- **Callback props** for child-to-parent communication
- **FormData API** for uncontrolled form handling
- **Immutable updates** with spread operator
- **Form validation** and user experience

### 🔍 What changed

**🔗 Commit**: [`88ed179`](3/commits/88ed1791b4ccfda6c71e289193d40b7393a187fa)

Messages become stateful in the Home component:

```javascript
const [messages, setMessages] = useState(initialMessages);

const addMessage = (formData) => {
  const message = formData.get("message")?.trim();
  if (!message) return;

  setMessages((currentMessages) => [
    ...currentMessages,
    { type: "user", text: message, id: Date.now() },
  ]);
};
```

### 💡 Think about this

Where should the messages state live? In ChatInput, ChatMessages, or Home? What are the trade-offs of each choice?

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **What's the difference between controlled and uncontrolled forms?** When would you use each approach?
2. **Why validate empty messages?** How does this improve user experience?

### 🔍 Explore the code

Type messages and watch them appear in the chat! Notice how the form clears after submission.

### ✅ Check your understanding

- Try submitting an empty message. What happens and why?
- Modify the addMessage function to add a timestamp to each message.

## Step 7: Advanced state patterns with real-time filtering

### 🤔 Problem to solve

As users accumulate many chat threads, finding specific conversations becomes difficult. We need search functionality that filters threads in real-time as users type.

### 💡 Key concepts

- **Controlled components** where React manages input values
- **Computed state** - deriving data without additional useState
- **Real-time filtering** with array methods
- **Case-insensitive search** for better user experience
- **When to compute vs store** - performance considerations

### 🔍 What changed

**🔗 Commit**: [`6425c64`](3/commits/6425c6405fc04155a264ccb683c11fb31698bb22)

A search input with computed filtering is added:

```javascript
const [searchValue, setSearchValue] = useState("");

// Computed state - no additional useState needed!
const filteredThreads = threads.filter((thread) =>
  thread.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchValue.toLowerCase())
);
```

### 💡 Think about this

Should `filteredThreads` be stored in state with `useState`, or computed on each render? What are the performance implications?

### 💬 Discussion points

1. **Controlled vs uncontrolled components**: What are the benefits and drawbacks of each approach?
2. **When should you compute state vs store it?** Consider memory usage and re-render frequency.

### 🔍 Explore the code

Type in the search box and watch threads filter in real-time! Try partial matches and different cases.

### ✅ Check your understanding

- What happens if you search for something that doesn't match any threads?
- Try implementing "clear search" functionality - where would you add it?
